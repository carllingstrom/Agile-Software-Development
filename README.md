## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
- Python (v3.7 or later)
- Flask (can be installed via pip)

## Installation

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```sh
    cd backend
    ```

2. Install the necessary Python dependencies (preferably in a virtual environment):
    ```sh
    pip install flask
    ```

## Running the Project

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory if you're not already there:
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Start the development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

### Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory if you're not already there:

    ```

2. Start the Flask application:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```






## **Project Description**

This project aims to develop a web application that empowers users to evaluate the economic feasibility of installing solar panels, primarily focusing on the pay-back time. Users can interact with the application by inputting key details like their geographical location, installation costs, and the efficiency of the solar panels. The application will then present users with comprehensive outputs including economic returns, emission reductions, and total power generation capabilities of the panels.


To ensure user confidence in the application, the website will be designed to be user-friendly, incorporating clear explanations of the calculations performed. Leveraging a weather API, the application will gather solar power data across different geographical areas to provide accurate and personalized outcomes.

## **Connection to UN Sustainability Goals**

### This project directly contributes to several United Nations Sustainable Goals (UN SDGs), especially:

#### **Goal #7:**
Affordable & Clean Energy - By demonstrating the economic viability of solar panel investments, the application encourages individuals to contribute to the green transformation, making clean energy more accessible and affordable.

#### **Goal #11:**
Sustainable Cities & Communities - Promoting local energy production enhances city resilience and sustainability, contributing to safer and more sustainable urban environments.

Further Connections: 
The project also aligns with Goal #12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), #13 (Climate Action), and #9 (Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure), supporting global efforts towards sustainable development.

## **Mapping the Process**

The development process is organized into three primary segments, allowing for agile project management:

1. User-Friendly Website
Creating an engaging and trustworthy website is crucial for encouraging user interaction and ensuring the application's societal value. The site will provide insights into the application's workings and feature a design that emphasizes reliability.

2. Connection to a Quality API
The selected API will supply detailed solar power data, necessary for accurate calculations. The data must be granular enough to offer individualized responses and valuable outputs.

3. Correct and Useful Output
Outputs generated by the application will be both accurate and user-friendly, ensuring the information provided is valuable and easy to understand. The goal is to produce results that users can trust and effectively use in their decision-making process.
